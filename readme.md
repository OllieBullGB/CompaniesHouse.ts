## About
This repository contains a type-safe wrapper for the [Companies House Public Data API](https://developer-specs.company-information.service.gov.uk/companies-house-public-data-api/reference). Simplifying access to the UK government's Companies House service to access and retrieve publically available information about registered companies in the United Kingdom.

### What is Companies House?

Companies House is a government agency in the United Kingdom that keeps records of all registered companies and their important information. It serves as a central repository where businesses are required to submit their details, such as company name, address, directors, and financial statements.

The purpose of Companies House is to promote transparency and provide easy access to essential data about companies for the public and government authorities. By maintaining these records, Companies House ensures that businesses operate within the legal framework and helps people make informed decisions when dealing with companies.
